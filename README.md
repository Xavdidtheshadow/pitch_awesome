# Pitch Awesome

A cappella assistant, pitch pipe, and key-rememberer.

Also, my first actual iOS project!

Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

Tones (square) generated [here](http://onlinetonegenerator.com/) and cut with Audacity.

The frequencies were found in [this]() Wikipedia article. I provide notes from 261hz to 987hz. 

You can download it in the store [here](http://bit.ly/pitch_awesome)!
